## 📄 Overview

This project provides a lightweight, efficient, and secure solution for hosting static web applications.  
It bundles a Vite-built frontend and serves it via NGINX inside a Docker container, ensuring quick load times and minimal resource usage.

Originally developed as part of a **DevOps technical test**, showcasing best practices for building, optimizing, and deploying containerized static sites.

---

## 🔧 Features

- **Vite Build Integration**  
  Serves optimized static assets generated by Vite.

- **NGINX Web Server**  
  Fast and reliable delivery with caching support.

- **Minimal Footprint**  
  Slim, production-grade base images reduce size and potential vulnerabilities.

- **Cross-Environment Portability**  
  Runs identically across development, staging, and production environments.

- **Easy to Extend**  
  Customize the NGINX configuration or use behind a reverse proxy/CDN.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Pull the Image

```bash
docker pull ilouckov/static-vite-nginx-dockerized
```

### Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 ilouckov/static-vite-nginx-dockerized
```

Visit your site at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

> Note: This is **not** an SPA (Single Page Application).  
> NGINX serves static files directly as individual pages or assets.  
> Deep linking or direct navigation to nested URLs requires corresponding files in the build output (`dist/`).

## 🏗 Building the Image Locally

```bash
docker build -t ilouckov/static-vite-nginx-dockerized .
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- This image is best suited for **production-ready static sites**.
- The project uses a **custom public directory** configuration in `vite.config.js` to manage static assets during build.
- Uses a **multi-stage Docker build**: the Vite app is built inside the container during the first stage (Node.js), and the final image only contains static assets served by NGINX.
- The app does **not** use client-side routing (SPA behavior) and expects direct static file serving.
- The `nginx.conf` can be customized to add gzip compression, custom headers, or SPA routing **if the app is modified in the future to require it**.
- Each URL maps to a static file generated at build time.
- Designed with simplicity and reliability in mind — suitable for DevOps test cases, personal projects, or real-world deployments.
